# Development Commands

This project uses `pnpm` as its package manager. Below are common commands for development tasks:

- **Build Project**:
  To build all packages in the workspace:

  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```

  This runs the "build" script defined in the root `package.json`, which recursively builds all workspace packages.

- **Run Tests**:
  To run tests for the project:

  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```

  Note: The current `test` script in `package.json` is a placeholder: `"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"`. You may need to update this script in individual package `package.json` files for actual testing.

- **Format Code**:
  To format code using `trunk fmt`:

  ```bash
  pnpm format
  # or to format all files
  pnpm format:all
  ```

- **Lint Code**:
  To lint code using `trunk check`:

  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  # or to lint all files
  pnpm lint:all
  # or to lint for security issues
  pnpm lint:security
  ```
